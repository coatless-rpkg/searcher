\title{AI Prompt Management System}
\description{
A set of functions to manage and apply prompts for AI search services.
These functions allow you to create, maintain, and use a library of
effective prompts for different AI assistants and scenarios.
}
\details{
The prompt management system works with multiple levels of prompts:
\enumerate{
\item System-level prompt: Set with \code{ai_prompt()}, applies across all AI services
\item Service-specific prompts: Set with \code{options()} or in function calls
\item Default prompts: Built-in prompts that ship with the package
}

When a search is performed, prompts are applied in this order, with the
query at the end.
}
