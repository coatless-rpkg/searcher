# Introduction

When trying to solve a problem, part of the process is to research what attempts
have been made by others. The most common form of research is to **query
a search portal**. One downside to this approach is that each search portal has
its own set of operators or query phrasing that will yield relevant content.
As a result, those that have domain knowledge are able to format the
search query in a way that is better. Still many queries are not constrained
enough to the programming language being used. The goal of `searcher` is to
attempt to address both needs by providing a convenient pre-specified search
interface that tailors the results to _R_.

# Usage

To begin using `searcher`, first install the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=searcher).

```r
# Install the searcher package if not already installed
install.packages("searcher")
```

Once installed, searching with `searcher` is done by using one or more of the
`search_*()` functions. To access these functions, either use a namespace 
function call of `searcher::search_*()` or load the `searcher` package and,
then, call the function.

```r
# Loads the searcher package
library("searcher")

# Searches using Google for `tips`
search_google("tips")
```


# Search Operators

Within the `searcher` package, each `search_*()` function has the parameter
of `rlang = TRUE`. By default, this enforces a search that guarantees
_R_-specific results. If `rlang = FALSE`, then the results are generalized.

- Search Engines
   - All search engines affix `"r programming"` to the end of the query to 
     constrain the results to be _R_-specific.
   - `"r programming"` was selected because it performed best when compared
     to `"rlang"`, `"rstats"`, and `"r language"` on [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/).
- Community Sites
   - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): ` <query> + [r]`
   - Twitter: `<query> + #rstats`
   - [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/search) (formerly RStudio Community): `<query>`
   - [Rseek](https://rseek.org/): `<query>`
- Code Repositories
   - [GitHub Search](https://github.com/search): `<query> language:r type:issue`
   - [Bitbucket Search](https://bitbucket.org/search): `<query> lang:r`

# General Search Tips

To improve your _R_-related search query, it has been suggested to use: 

- `"r how to do <x>"`
    - `"r how to remove legends in ggplot"`
    - This is a baseline search query.
- `"<package name> <problem>"`
    - `"ggplot2 fix x-axis labels."`
    - If the package is _R_-specific, it may help dropping `r` and instead
      focusing on the package name at the start of the query.
- `"r <package-name> <problem> <year> site:<specific-site>`
    - `"r ggplot2 center graph title 2018 site:stackoverflow.com`
    - By specifying the package name, a year, and target site the "freshest" 
      solution will likely be found.

# Search Platform URLs

The `searcher` package uses specific URLs to direct searches to various
platforms. Understanding these URLs can be helpful for troubleshooting 
or creating custom search functions.

## Search Engines

The following search engines are supported with their corresponding base URLs:

| Function | Service | Base URL |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `search_google()` | Google | `https://google.com/search?q=` |
| `search_bing()` | Bing | `https://bing.com/search?q=` |
| `search_duckduckgo()` / `search_ddg()` | DuckDuckGo | `https://duckduckgo.com/?q=` |
| `search_startpage()` / `search_sp()` | Startpage | `https://startpage.com/do/dsearch?query=` |
| `search_ecosia()` | Ecosia | `https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=` |
| `search_qwant()` | Qwant | `https://www.qwant.com/?q=` |
| `search_brave()` | Brave Search | `https://search.brave.com/search?q=` |
| `search_kagi()` | Kagi | `https://kagi.com/search?q=` |
| `search_rseek()` | Rseek | `https://rseek.org/?q=` |

## Community Sites

Community and developer discussion platforms:

| Function | Service | Base URL |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `search_stackoverflow()` / `search_so()` | StackOverflow | `https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=` |
| `search_posit_community()` / `search_posit()` | Posit Community | `https://forum.posit.co/search?q=` |
| `search_twitter()` / `search_x()` | Twitter/X | `https://twitter.com/search?q=` |
| `search_mastodon()` | Mastodon | `https://mastodon.social/search?q=` |
| `search_bluesky()` | BlueSky | `https://bsky.app/search?q=` |

## Code Repositories

Code hosting and search platforms:

| Function | Service | Base URL | Additional Parameters |
|----------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| `search_github()` / `search_gh()` | GitHub | `https://github.com/search?q=` | `&type=Issues` |
| `search_grep()` | grep.app | `https://grep.app/search?q=` | N/A |
| `search_bitbucket()` / `search_bb()` | BitBucket | `https://bitbucket.com/search?q=` | N/A |

## URL Construction

When you use a search function, the final URL is constructed by:

1. **Base URL**: The platform's search endpoint
2. **Encoded Query**: Your search term, URL-encoded for safety
3. **R-specific Keywords**: Added automatically when `rlang = TRUE` (default)
4. **Additional Parameters**: Platform-specific options (like GitHub's `&type=Issues`)

For example, when you run:

```r
search_github("data visualization")
```

The constructed URL becomes:

```default
https://github.com/search?q=data%20visualization%20language%3Ar%20type%3Aissue&type=Issues
```
